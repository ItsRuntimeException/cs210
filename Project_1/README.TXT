PROJECT TITLE: Polynomial
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To test out different arithmetic operations on a polynomial.
VERSION or DATE: 9/12/2016
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: N/A
AUTHORS: Run Dong Lin
USER INSTRUCTIONS: N/A

1.  Why is it a good idea to choose names like plus and minus for the methods that perform polynomial arithmetic?

	To easily understand what the operation is mean't to perform.


2.  Explain why you can pass an array of Polynomial objects to the Arrays.sort method which requires an array of Comparable objects?

	The Array is casted by the <E> type: Polynomials, thus this array can be sorted in terms of Polynomials, 
	and by creating a new compareTo method that overrides the original method, now the Polynomials will sort in order.


3.  Did you use the Dr Java debugger?  Was it useful and how did you use it?

	I did not use the Dr Java debugger.


4.  Was it helpful to have the provided TestPolynomial class while writing the code in your Polynomial class?  How did you use it?

	Yes! The TestPolynomial class have multiple test parameters to give a visual that was convient on the side when coding.
	For example, knowing what the methods in Polynomial class would be named, and the types of parameters to be passed in.


5.  Did the javadoc web pages for your Polynomial class and for the Arrays class help you to write your application class at the end?  How did you use them?

	No, I didn't know I was supposed to use it.
